# JSON-and-EJS-exercise

This is an exercise/challenge from Angela Yu's Web Development course. It requires you to use JSON and EJS and create an functional website at the end.
I didn't create the original EJS, CSS, JSON files nor the Node Module files.
They were all provided by the course. However, the functional part that requires JavaScript and EJS is written by me. 

There are 3 seperate buttons on the website, and when you click on one of them, it gets the data from an API JSON file changes the text under the buttons. Basically, the code runs like this:
Listen to the button clicks -> when the button gets clicked, GET the necessary data from the JSON file -> POST or PUT and change the text on the EJS page in accordance with the data.

It sounds very simple when I write it like this but this challenge requires me to know or learn many things :)
